<h2>üßê Features</h2>
Logistic Regression Algorithm: The model utilizes logistic regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks, which makes it efficient and effective for distinguishing between real and fake news.

Interpretability: The model's predictions are not only accurate but also interpretable, as it highlights the linguistic cues and features that contribute to its decision-making process.

The trained model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
